# CodeBookClub Resources
This is a collection of resources that we share at our CodeBookClub. As the main topic is **JavaScript**, the most of the resources are about it.

**If you want to know more about the club or if you want to join us, [check this out](https://dev.to/madisonkanna/join-our-javascript-book-club-l4k "check this out"). You can also follow the [CodeBookClub](https://twitter.com/codebookclub) on Twitter.**
